# Assembler - LSControlTower F1
Project named "LSControlTower", part of the "Digital Systems & Microprocessors" subject. 

Simulates the controls of a ship that has been built using a PIC18 micro, servo, motor, LED indicators, push buttons and a joystick.

Some of the functionalities of the ship include: 

-Real time throttle and direction control, outputing PWM system to control the motor and servo. Current speed and direction values are displayed on LED displays

-Recording of several values of direction and speed, in order to be able to replicate them later with exactly the same time spacing between each recorded direction and speed value.
